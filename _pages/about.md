I am a fourth-year undergraduate student in [Turing class](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/research/turing_program/introduction1/index.htm), [School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). In summer 2023 , I had a research internship in CMU hosted byÂ [Prof. Beidi Chen](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/beidic/). Currently, I am a research intern at [Microsoft Research Asia NLC Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/natural-language-computing/), working under the guidance of [Dr. Chenfei Wu](https://chenfei-wu.github.io/). I am privileged to have been accepted into the  NLP PhD program at Peking University, where I will be advised by [Prof. Dongyan Zhao](https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/zhaodongyan/ywjj/) and [Prof. Huishuai Zhang](https://huishuai-git.github.io/).

My research interests lie in demystifying alignment and leveraging LLMs for real-world tasks. Here are the core problems I'm thinking about:
* What specific knowledge/ability do LLMs acquire through alignment?
* Is superalignment applicable? How can we achieve superalignment?
* What are the ability boundarieas for LLMs in real-world scenarios?
